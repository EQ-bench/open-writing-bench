      "writing_prompt": "Write a chapter set in rural northern Sweden in the mid-1990s. Linnea, a teenage girl from Stockholm, has reluctantly moved to a small village with her parents after her father's job transfer. She's befriended Astrid, a local girl who claims her grandmother taught her ancient practices passed down through generations. Astrid has been introducing Linnea to \"midnight games\" that involve old rituals, convincing her they can use them to learn classmates' secrets or influence their behavior. Tonight, Astrid has convinced Linnea to participate in Útiseta—sitting out on an ancient burial mound at midnight to \"receive knowledge from beyond.\" The chapter focuses on this single midnight excursion, the ritualistic preparations, Astrid's matter-of-fact instructions that mix teenage rebellion with eerily specific traditional elements, and the mounting tension as Linnea becomes increasingly uncertain whether they're simply scaring themselves or if something is actually responding to their presence. The narrative should maintain ambiguity about whether the strange occurrences are supernatural or psychological, while establishing the dangerous line they're crossing by treating ancient practices as entertainment.\n\nFirst person, past tense, told as Linnea's recollection of events in the present day (though this device should be largely transparent). 1000 words.\n\n<SEED> Length: 1000 words.",
