    "writing_prompt": "Young adult drama\nGone South\nTaylor is a 16 year old teen with a history of \"concerning behavioural patterns\" (or that's how the stupid smug school counsellor worded it on the phone call to Mom). It shouldn't be a surprise: When you live in a backwater town in Tennessee, your choices are: a. be mind-fuckingly bored, or b. invent some drama. Two days ago, Taylor came out to their family as trans. This disclosure was *not* in the category of invented drama -- it was, in fact, the real deal, and a long time coming. It didn't go well. The last 48 hours had been pure disaster. In a moment of desperate inspiration, Taylor had decided to get the hell out of dodge. And so an escape plan was hatched and executed within the space of 30 minutes. That was last night. Now Taylor was two states away, having been unceremoniously ejected from their hitched ride in downtown New Orleans. Write the next chapter in Taylor's story as they find their feet in this new environment. Tell the chapter over the course of their first day in New Orleans, in which Taylor meets another runaway with issues and secrets. Taylor navigates this new world, not knowing who to trust or what the dangers are. Write in Taylor's voice, and incorporate their internal monologue as they grapple with intense & conflicting emotions. Also incorporate dialogue with the interesting characters Taylor meets. First person, mixed tense. <SEED> 1000 words.",

    "writing_prompt": "Whalepunk fantasy\nThe Morska thieves guild experiences a sudden power vacuum as its leader was arrested in a raid in the early hours of the morning. Aya, a young woman born into aristocracy, has a keen interest in both the sciences and the arcane, having inherited her mother's gift for immateria magick (an outlawed practice for which her mother was, regrettably, hanged by the neck). Aya, bored with the world of aristocracy, has been spending her nights moonlighting with this very guild (masked, naturally). Leveraging her latent ability to summon dark entities from the immateria, she quickly rose through the ranks of the guild. Now, recognising the opportunity of the sudden power vacuum, Aya and her close companions Katra and Simeon, make a play for heart of the guild's claim to power: an ancient scythan artifact, under guard of spell and key in the depths of the guild hq. In contrast with the desperate chaos they had navigated thus far, the entrance to the underhold felt suddenly too quiet. Aya braces herself and reaches for the door.\n\nWrite the next scene as the trio enter the underhold and find themselves confronted by none other than the guild leader herself, decidedly *un*-incarcerated, and in possession of both weapons and bodyguards.\n\nPaint a vivid picture of of the confrontation. Story beats: Aya is captured and unmasked. The trio are captured. Aya attempts to stall their demise by negotiating on her value as a hostage -- as she grapples with the inevitable consequences of her role in the guild being brought to light. Incorporate dialogue in the authentic voices of the characters. Do not write a fight scene. Lean into the gritty Victorian aesthetic with the dialogue & worldbuilding, as well as elements of gothic horror. In this world, men trust brass and oil and steel; magicka is feared and barely understood. Write in third person past tense, incorporating both Aya's internal monologue, and a heavy dialogue component. <SEED> 1000 words.",

    "writing_prompt": "Classic sci-fi (Author style: Asimov)\n\nColonial mars is being mined by corporations who take leases on indentured labourers. The thing they are mining is Azra, a recently discovered exotic metal which accelerates radioactive decay to such a rate that it is greatly sought after for interstellar drives and weapons alike. This has created both a gold rush and an arms race as various interests vie for control and endeavour to unlock Azra's secrets. The story follows Arthur Neegan, a first generation settler and mining engineer. Upon discovering that his unassuming plot sits atop an immense Azra vein, he is subjected to a flurry of interest and scrutiny. Write the next chapter in this story, in which an armed retinue descends on Arthur's home and politely but forcefully invites him to a meeting with some unknown party off-world. The insignia look like that of the Antares diplomatic corp -- diplomatic in name only. Arthur finds himself in the centre of a political tug of war. The chapter involves a meeting with this unknown party, who makes Arthur an offer. The scene should be primarily dialogue, interspersed with vivid description & scene setting. It should sow hints of the larger intrigue, stakes & dangers. Include Asimov's trademark big-and-small-picture world building and retrofuturistic classic scifi vibe.
