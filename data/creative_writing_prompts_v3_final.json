        "writing_prompt": "Caribou Season at the Lodge\nGenre: Surreal Horror\n\nJT knew something wasn't right from the moment they'd pulled up to the lodge. It looked exactly as it had every autumn of his life—the cedar shingles silvered with age, the porch sagging gently under weight of winters past—but the air felt thicker, somehow, as if the woods had leaned in closer, waiting. He thought maybe he was just tired. Maybe it was nothing more than the long drive north, cramped in the back of the truck beside his older brother Mike -- and a stack of rifles wrapped in oily canvas. Still, the feeling lingered.\n\nThe first caribou they found that season hadn't bolted. It had just watched, ears flicking lazily, waiting for the shot. JT had felt a crawling in his gut watching it die, noticing how it fell with a quiet dignity—as though it had wanted nothing more. Nobody else seemed to find it odd, or at least they didn't say so. JT kept his mouth shut. Always safer that way.\n\nThen there was the moment in the clearing. JT had fallen behind, fumbling with bootlaces stiff from the cold, and by the time he'd caught up with his father and brother, they'd already stopped. JT slowed instinctively, ducking behind a tangle of brush, staring out into the open space where a massive buck stood utterly still, chest rising and falling in slow, deep breaths. The animal looked…wrong, somehow. Maybe it was the eyes—dark and flat, calm in a way that made JT's neck prickle. Or maybe it was something deeper, something in the way the buck stood close enough for his father to reach out and touch it.\n\nJT watched as his father raised a trembling hand toward the animal's muzzle. His father's face had a strange expression, eyes too bright, lips parted slightly, like he was on the verge of whispering something—a secret, maybe. The rifle hung uselessly at his side, forgotten. Mike had the same dazed look in his eyes.  JT's breath stopped short, his mind suddenly shouting at him to look away, turn around, just run—but he couldn't move.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. The buck shivered, startled by something unseen, and disappeared into the brush without so much as a sound. The two of them looked around, confused, seemingly surprised to find themselves where they stood. JT stayed hidden, breathing shallowly, fear mingling with a confused sense of shame. His father had failed to take the shot. To even think about mentioning what he'd seen would have felt like betrayal—or something worse.\n\nJT waited until the others moved on before stepping out from cover. He stared into the empty clearing for a long, uneasy moment, wondering if anything had really happened at all, or if he was losing his grip. Maybe the woods were finally getting into his head.\n\nWriting Instructions:\nContinue with the next chapter of the story, maintaining a style reminiscent of Stephen King—grounded realism blended seamlessly with unsettling surrealism. The atmosphere should convey subtle dread, isolation, and psychological ambiguity. JT's perspective is crucial, yet he is an unreliable narrator, caught in uncertainty about what he's perceiving. <SEED> Establish an undertone of creeping dread, establishing the isolation of JT's perspective, which he largely keeps to himself.

Write a dark fantasy scene with comedic elements set in the Courts of Dream where a case is being heard to determine ownership of a contested dreamscape. Mora, the Slavic nightmare spirit who sits on sleepers' chests causing paralysis and terror, has recently invaded and subverted a carefully crafted recurring dream of a schoolboy, Max. The dream originally featured the boy lying in a field of wildflowers with his crush, always culminating in a muddled almost-kiss and a pleasant confusion of emotions.\nThis dream was the meticulous work of \"First Love\" (a rosy-cheeked, slightly bashful entity who crafts formative romantic experiences). However, Mora has recently infiltrated the dreamscape, transforming the scene so that when the girl playfully mounts the boy, she morphs into a terrifying yet somehow still confusingly attractive vision who proceeds to sit on his chest and feed on his breath. Mora's defense largely consists of the practical argument that \"a girl's gotta eat too, you know?\"\nWrite this scene as it unfolds in the courtroom of the Dreaming, with Dream's demeanour, typically impenetrable, betraying a sense of irritation at having to adjudicate such matters. The comedy should derive from the farcical situation, familiar elements of courtroom drama intersecting with the fantastical world of the Dreaming, and the droll portrayal of the characters and their interactions.

We are also going against the obvious fish-out-of-water trope; in fact, he's surprisingly a natural at this.
